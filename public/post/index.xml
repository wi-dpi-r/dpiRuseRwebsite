      <description>At today&amp;rsquo;s meeting, we welcomed some new members from DHS, DCF and DWD. It was fun to make these connections and see how other agencies are using R.
In the second half of the program, Carl led a discussion about redacting tabular/aggregated data for external data requests. The focus was on the sdcTable package. The R Markdown file that created the slides are available online here.</description>
