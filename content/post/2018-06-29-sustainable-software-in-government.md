Discussion Questions:

  - Are you a bespoke software engineer ... implications for personal workflow?
  - Who produces "Official Statistics"?
  - Which reason for sustainability resonated the most?
    - Outputs really matter ... ***T***ruth
    - Periodic collaborative authoring (with high turnover)
