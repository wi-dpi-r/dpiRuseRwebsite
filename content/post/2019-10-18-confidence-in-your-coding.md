Come join the discussion this Friday (10/18/2019) about the various methods 
available to be confident that your R code is doing what you think it's doing. 

We will plan to cover:

- Defensive programming,
- Quality assurance, and
- Unit testing.

What other things do you do?  Does it vary by project? I have a sparse 
presentation because I want to hear from everybody. That said, don't feel 
intimidated, this stuff is the programming equivalent of flossing.
