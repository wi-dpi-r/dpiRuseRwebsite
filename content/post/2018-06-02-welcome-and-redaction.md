At today's meeting, we welcomed some new members from DHS, DCF and DWD. It was fun to make these 
connections and see how other agencies are using R.

In the second half of the program, Carl led a discussion about redacting tabular/aggregated data for 
external data requests. The focus was on the 
[`sdcTable` package](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/sdcTable/index.html). The R Markdown file that created the slides are 
available online [here](https://github.com/wi-dpi-r/2016-06-01_welcomeRedaction).
